NAME
    Acme::emcA - Acme::emcA

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.11 of Acme::emcA, released October 14,
    2007.

SYNOPSIS
        use Acme::emcA;
        print "Hello, World";

DESCRIPTION
    The first time you run a program under "use Acme::emcA", the module
    takes your source file and makes an mirror image of it at both row- and
    column- level. The code continues to work exactly as it did before, but
    now it looks like this:

                    ;use Acme::emcA esu;

        ;"!dlroW ,olleH" tnirpprint "Hello, World!";

        ;"!dlroW ,olleH" tnirpprint "Hello, World!";

                    ;use Acme::emcA esu;

DIAGNOSTICS
    "Can't reverse "%s""
        Acme::emcA could not access the source file to modify it.
